# Contribution from resekneb

Hey benkeser, here is some great new code. And I’ve included an R chunk
below!

``` r
print("hello from R")
```

    ## [1] "hello from R"

``` r
Sys.Date()
```

    ## [1] "2022-10-14"

# Another BIG contribution from resekneb

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago – never mind how long precisely – having
little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on
short, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
the world.

# A direct contribution from benkeser

Here is a change I’ll push directly to Github as benkeser!
